# My very first web page

Welcome!

This is my very first website and also my first experience using Git and GitHub

I have created the website using an online IDE - Cloud9 and using HTML and CSS.
In the website I have used html/css to create a navbar and link to various technologies using images as links

I have uploaded the site to GitHub using git commands

Any questions please contact me on steven.a.horne@btinternet.com
